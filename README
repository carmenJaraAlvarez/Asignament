This program resolve assigment problem with Branch and Bound algorithm in parallel architectures.
It has a generalist structure that allows to be adapted to different combinational problems. It also has different optional branching, pruning and distribution algorithms.
The graphical interface with gtk can be bypassed launching by parameters for massive tets. There is a script "launch_tests.sh" where you can configurate them.
The mpe2 library has been used to display logs graphically. The "launch_jumpshot.sh" script can be used to automatically display them.
